# Purpose

To control the files and build utilities used to create the basic resume.

To see the results of the build, checkout the [html version of the resume](https://slightlynybbledresume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)!

Still a bit of a work-in-progress, but it is nearly feature complete!

## Building the Resume

To make a normal HTML page with full navigation:

    make html

To make a single-page version:
