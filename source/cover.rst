Greetings -

I am a candidate with a diverse set of skills that are an asset in any modern organization.  I have
experience including electrical design, mechanical design, manufacturing, tooling, software creation,
and data science amongst others.  I have a track record of being a product owner from beginning to
end, from wiping tables to writing software.

I look forward to speaking with you in the near future,
