A More Personal Take

First Working Years
-------------------

I graduated from Galax High School in southwest Virginia in the summer of 1998.
I had done well in school, but lacked direction.  After a couple of years of
retail and summer manufacturing jobs, I joined the Army as a Fire Support 
Specialist, also known as a 13F.

My experiences in the military were very formative.  Any direction that I lacked 
in the civilian world was quickly replaced by my leadership.  I succeeded in training
and did little to distinguish myself - positively or negatively - with no Article
15 activity and an honorable discharge.

Post-Army Education
-------------------

I left the Army in August of 2004 and decided to utilize the Montgomery
GI Bill to complete my education.  I had completed several classes while
in high school and in the military, so I was able to finish two Associate's
degrees within a year.

I completed a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering Technology in 2007
and began work immediately after that.

Professional Life
-----------------

First Steps 
***********

My first job after school was as a technician for an electronics repair 
company, `Advanced Electronic Services (AES) <https://www.aesintl.com/>`_.  
I really liked working here and I learned a lot about the real application 
of electronics in the real world.  Unfortunately, the engineering position 
that I was seeking at the time didn't come open in the short time that I was working 
here, so I had to move on.

Design Engineering!
*******************

My next job was as an electronics and firmware design engineer for 
`Moog, Inc <https://www.moog.com/>`_. in
what was, then, the Components Group in Blacksburg, Virginia.  I 
learned electrical and firmware design and practiced for about 10 
years before moving on to a similar role in Radford, VA.

My mentors in Blacksburg gave me enough guidance to enable me to learn 
the basics of mechanical design in addition to my other duties and 
I was able to quickly advance beyond my electrical training.

There was a interlude of about 1 year around 2015 in which I participated in
a startup which ultimately failed.  This venture, though ultimately unworkable,
gave me the opportunity to learn Python and software development for a number
of other microcontroller architectures.

In the spring of 2017, the financials of the product line that I was a part of
were not looking positive and I was re-allocated to a very similar role in Radford,
Virginia, where I brought to the team a more modern approach to data, development,
and source control that greatly benefited me and the team in Radford.

Stepping Up
***********

Around 2019 in Moog, Inc. Radford, I became interested in a more meaningful role
in the organization and expressed some interest in management.  I was allocated
a role as the Electrical Engineering Manager and, upon a small local reorganization,
I continued as the design manager in the subsequent role as the Design Engineering
Manager.

Throughout this time, I was able to modernize several design engineering processes
and creating an environment of learning and stability in a world that was turned
on its head in the `chaotic environment of 2020 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19>`_.

Stepping Back from Leadership
*****************************

In the winter of 2022, I saw the organization that I had come to be part of
stumbling and failing on multiple metrics.  There were many signs that our organization
was stressed and in need of some systemic change and I volunteered to step down and lead
a multidisciplinary team of professionals.  In the spring of 2022, my leadership
accepted this proposal, but did not accept that there would be a team of support... I would
be the team.

I was re-titled "Continuous Improvement Lead" and, in this role, I was able to learn a
great deal about the manufacturing process and I developed a love for the process
of manufacturing consistent and high-quality products.  I found a great deal of satisfaction
in simple as well as complex improvements to the product and quality of life on the production
floor.

Stepping Up Once More 
*********************

In mid 2023, my leadership approached me about leading the manufacturing engineering team in
the title of "Operations Engineering Manager".  This grand title was actually responsible for
the leadership of 2 manufacturing engineers, 2 technicians, and 3 test engineers.  In this role,
we were able to align and improve the performance and yield of several products, including the
data cooling pump product lines which were to become a key that unlocked some future elements.

Back to Design
**************

At the beginning of 2024, it appeared that the business unit was going to get a turn-around.  Our
new general manager asked me to shift back into design as the upper management team had identified
data cooling pumps as the next big thing and they wanted me to lead the engineering team that
was to design the next generation of data cooling pumps, electronics and all.  I accepted, and
became the "Cooling Pumps Technical Lead".
