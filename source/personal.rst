A More Personal Take

First Working Years
-------------------

I graduated from Galax High School in southwest Virginia in the summer of 1998.
I had done well in school, but lacked direction.  After a couple of years of
retail and summer manufacturing jobs, I joined the Army as a Fire Support 
Specialist.

My experiences in the military were very formative.  Any direction that I lacked 
in the civilian world was quickly replaced by my leadership.  I succeeded in training
and was generally a good soldier with no Article 15 activity and an honorable
discharge.

Additionally, I married a wonderfuly woman whom I had met in high 
school in my hometown and we have been married for over 20 years now.

Post-Army Education
-------------------

I left the Army in August of 2004 and decided to utilize the Montgomery
GI Bill to complete my education.  I had completed several classes while
in high school and in the military, so I was able to finish two Associate's
degrees within a year.

I was able to complete a Bachelor's degree in 2007 and began work immediately
after that.

Professional Life
-----------------

First Steps 
***********

My first job after school was as a technician for an electronics repair 
company, `Advanced Electronic Services (AES) <https://www.aesintl.com/>`_.  
I really liked working here and I learned a lot about the real application 
of electronics in the real world.  Unfortunately, the engineering position 
that I was seeking at the time didn't come open in the short time that I was working 
here, so I had to move on.

My next job was as an electronics and firmware design engineer for 
`Moog, Inc <https://www.moog.com/>`_. in
what was, then, the Components Group in Blacksburg, Virginia.  I 
learned electrical and firmware design and practiced for about 10 
years before moving on to a similar role in Radford, VA.

My mentors in Blacksburg gave me enough guidance to enable me to learn 
the basics of mechanical design in addition to my other duties and 
I was able to quickly advance beyond my electrical training.

There was a interlude of about 2 years around 2015 in which I participated in 
a startup which ultimately failed.  This venture, though ultimately unworkable,
gave me the opportunity to learn Python and software development for a number
of other microcontroller architectures.

In the spring of 2017, the financials of the product line that I was a part of
were not looking positive and I was re-allocated to a very similar role in Radford,
Virginia, where I brought to the team a more modern approach to data, development,
and source control that greatly benefited me and the team in Radford.

Management
**********

Around 2019 in Moog, Radford, I became interested in a more meaningful role 
in the organization and expressed some interest in management.  I was allocated
a role as the Electrical Engineering Manager and, upon a small local reorganization,
I continued as the design manager in the subsequent role as the Design Engineering
Manager.

Throughout this time, I was able to modernize sevaral design engineering processes
and creating an environment of learning and stability in a world that was turned
on its head in the `chaotic environment of 2020 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19>`_.
