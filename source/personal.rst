First Working Years
-------------------

I graduated from Galax High School in southwest Virginia in the summer of 1998.
I had done well in school, but lacked direction.  After a couple of years of
retail and summer manufacturing jobs, I joined the Army as a Fire Support 
Specialist.

My experiences in the military were very formative.  Any direction that I lacked 
in the civilian world was quickly replaced by my leadership.  I succeeded in training
and was generally a good soldier with no Article 15 activity and an honorable
discharge.

Additionally, I married a wonderfuly woman whom I had met in high 
school in my hometown and we have been married for over 20 years now.

Post-Army
---------

I left the Army in August of 2004 and decided to utilize the Montgomery
GI Bill to complete my education.  I had completed several classes while
in high school and in the military, so I was able to finish two Associate's
degrees within a year.

I was able to complete a Bachelor's degree in 2007 and began work immediately
after that.
